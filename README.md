## Problem Statement
<p>Asset financing has been a challenge for small businesses and even for individuals to improve their livelihoods. Unemployment is a significant issue in Kenya which stacks the metrics toward poverty as a result of lack of income. Businesses on the other hand pay hefty amounts of money to deliver their products through third parties thus significantly reducing their profit margin. Therefore, there is a need to bridge the gap that exists in the mass transportation and mobility sector in Kenya.</p>

## Problem Solution
<p>By providing a quick asset financing solution with an affordable down payment, we are able to break down barriers to achieving our full potential. PataBoda is an asset finance platform that will enable low-income earners to acquire two or three-wheelers to elevate their living standards. With just a down payment of Ksh 20,000, an individual or business is able to own a motorbike to support their business, or even start a business. </p>
